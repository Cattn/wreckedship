## How to play?

### The game is divided into 3 roles:

1. Captain
- The captain's job is to navigate the high seas! Move yourself from left, right, and center to dodge the dangerous rocks, and keep your ship from wrecking!
2. Shooter
- The shooter's job is to shoot cannon balls at the dangerous monsters lurking in the seas... Move yourself to the correct lane, and simply shake your phone/controller to fire!
3. The Enemy...
- The enemy is a powerful being with the power to move the sea... Move yourself to the left or right, and shake your controller to shift the tides in that direction, throwing the Shooter's off their game.

### Role assignment:
2P - **1 Captain, 1 Shooter**

3P - **1 Captain, 2 Shooters**

4P - **1 Captain, 2 Shooters, 1 Enemy**

### Can I play sitting down?
You likely can! It depends on your camera and lighting conditions, but theres a good chance the setup will work with you sitting down, and leaning side to side!

But where's the fun in that? ðŸ˜¸
